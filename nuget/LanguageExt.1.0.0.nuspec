        <description>Use and abuse the features of C#, which, if you squint, can look like extensions to the language itself.  This package is a functional 'toolkit' and also solves some of the annoyances with C#, namely:

            * Poor tuple support
            * Null reference problem
            * Lack of lambda and expression inference
            * Void isn't a real type
            * Mutable lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, etc.
            * The awful 'out' parameter

        The library very heavily focusses on correctness, to give you the tools needed to write safe declarative code.

        Features:

            Powerful 'prelude' which you include by `using static LanguageExt.Prelude` (in C# 6) that covers many of the basic functional language core library functions and types (from `using LanguageExt`):

                Pattern matching
                Lambda type-inference: `var fn = fun( (int x, int y) =&gt; x + y );`
                `Option&lt;T&gt;`, `OptionUnsafe&lt;T&gt;`, `Either&lt;L,R&gt;`, `EitherUnsafe&lt;L,R&gt;` and `TryOption&lt;T&gt;` monads (probably the most complete implementations you'll find in the .NET world)
                `tuple(a,b,...)` - `Tuple` construction without typing `Tuple.Create(a,b,...)` as well as `map` to project the `Item1..ItemN` properties onto named values.
                `List` - immutable list 
                `Map` - immutable map                                                
                `Set` - immutable set
                `memo` - Memoization with auto-cache purging using weak-references
                `Writer` monad
                `Reader` monad
                `State` monad
                Extension methods and replacement functions for dealing with `out` (Int32.TryParse, IDictionary.TryGetValue, etc.)</description>
        <summary />
        <releaseNotes>Now that System.Collections.Immutable has been fully released (as version 1.1.36) we can now do a full release of Language-ext.  

            So here is version 1.0.0!

                    `ToEither` converts an `Option&lt;T&gt;` to an `Either&lt;L,T&gt;` (you must provide a default(L) value or func incase the Option is in a None state)

                    `IfNoneOrFail` method for handling both failure states separately (Some state uses identity function)

                    `TryOptionConfig.ErrorLogger` static variable which can be used to attach error logging behaviour to the `Fail` state of `TryOption`

                    `IfLeft` method (replaces `Failure`)
                    `Prelude.ifLeft` method (replaces `Prelude.failure`)

                `EitherUnsafe&lt;L,R&gt;`

            Updates:
                `Prelude.convert&lt;T&gt;` now returns `None` if input is `null` (it previously threw an exception)

            Fixes:
                Query.zip would go into an infinite loop. Fixed.
                Comments

            Deprecated:
                Dependency on ConcurrentHashTable
                `failure` and `Failure` (for `ifNone`, `IfNone`, `ifLeft`, etc.)
                Iter extension method in Query, it was causing resolution problems for the compiler.
                Removed `RightUnsafe` and `LeftUnsafe` from `Either`, these were a hangover from when `EitherUnsafe` didn't exist and `Either` had a dual role.  This isn't needed any more.</releaseNotes>
